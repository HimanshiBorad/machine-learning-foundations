# Machine Learning Specialization – Practical Implementations
Practical implementations and projects from Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Specialization, including model training, evaluation, and experiments.

## What this repo shows
- End-to-end ML workflow (data → model → evaluation)
- Practical understanding of bias–variance tradeoffs
- Proper model evaluation using multiple metrics
- Clean, well-documented experiments

## Structure
Each folder represents a key ML concept and includes:
- Notebook implementation
- Dataset (or link)
- Evaluation results
- Observations and improvements

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Goal
Build production-ready ML intuition and interview-ready explanations.
