# Machine Learning Specialization – Practical Implementations
Practical implementations and projects from Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Specialization, including model training, evaluation, and experiments.

## What this repo shows
- End-to-end ML workflow (data → model → evaluation)
- Practical understanding of bias–variance tradeoffs
- Proper model evaluation using multiple metrics
- Clean, well-documented experiments

## Structure
Each folder represents a key ML concept and includes:
- Notebook implementation
- Dataset (or link)
- Evaluation results
- Observations and improvements

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Goal
Build production-ready ML intuition and interview-ready explanations.

#### What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning:
- Learns patterns from data instead of hard-coded rules
- Used in ranking, vision, speech, recommendations
- Needs data + objective + evaluation

Machine Learning is field of study that gives the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed! ~ Authur Samuel (1959)

There are two Machine Learning Algorithms:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
