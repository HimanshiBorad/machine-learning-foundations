Machine Learning:
- Learns patterns from data instead of hard-coded rules
- Used in ranking, vision, speech, recommendations
- Needs data + objective + evaluation

Machine Learning is field of study that gives the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed! ~ Authur Samuel (1959)

There are two Machine Learning Algorithms:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
